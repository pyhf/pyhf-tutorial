While it won't necessarily be exhaustive, the aim is to summarize the current working knowledge of how High Energy Physics experiments such as ATLAS produce tables such as Table 20 from the Supersymmetry Electroweak 2-lepton, 2-jet analysis ([SUSY-2018-05](https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/SUSY-2018-05/)):\n",

Left to right: background-only model post-fit total expected background, with the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties; observed data; 95 CL upper limits on the visible cross-section ($\\langle A\\varepsilon\\sigma\\rangle_\\mathrm{obs}^{95}$) and on the number of signal events ($\\mathrm{S}_\\mathrm{obs}^{95}$). The sixth column ($\\mathrm{S}_\\mathrm{exp}^{95}$) shows the expected 95 CL upper limit on the number of signal events, given the expected number (and $\\pm1\\sigma$ excursions of the expectation) of background events. The last two columns indicate the confidence level of the background-only hypothesis ($\\mathrm{CL}_\\mathrm{b}$) and discovery $p$-value with the corresponding Gaussian significance ($Z(s=0)$). $\\mathrm{CL}_\\mathrm{b}$ provides a measure of compatibility of the observed data with the signal strength hypothesis at the 95 CL limit relative to fluctuations of the background, and $p(s=0)$ measures compatibility of the observed data with the background-only hypothesis relative to fluctuations of the background.

Left to right: background-only model post-fit total expected background, with the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties; observed data; 95 CL upper limits on the visible cross-section ($\\langle A\\varepsilon\\sigma\\rangle_\\mathrm{obs}^{95}$) and on the number of signal events ($\\mathrm{S}_\\mathrm{obs}^{95}$). The sixth column ($\\mathrm{S}_\\mathrm{exp}^{95}$) shows the expected 95 CL upper limit on the number of signal events, given the expected number (and $\\pm1\\sigma$ excursions of the expectation) of background events. The last two columns indicate the confidence level of the background-only hypothesis ($\\mathrm{CL}_\\mathrm{b}$) and discovery $p$-value with the corresponding Gaussian significance ($Z(s=0)$). $\\mathrm{CL}_\\mathrm{b}$ provides a measure of compatibility of the observed data with the signal strength hypothesis at the 95 CL limit relative to fluctuations of the background, and $p(s=0)$ measures compatibility of the observed data with the background-only hypothesis relative to fluctuations of the background. The $p$-value is capped at 0.5.\n",
